# HYBRID

HYBRID is a collection of a transient process models developed in the Modelica langauage capable of representing the physical dynamics of various integrated energy systems and processes. The models are developed in a modular way so as to allow users to quickly assemble and test various configurations and control systems. 

The systems studied are modular and made of an assembly of components. For example, a system could contain a hybrid nuclear reactor, a gas turbine, a battery and some renewables. This system would correspond to the size of a balance area, but in theory any size of system is imaginable. The system is modeled in the ‘Modelica/Dymola’ language.

To assess the economics of the system, an optimization procedure varying different parameters can be run using the INL [FORCE](https://ies.inl.gov/SitePages/Technology%20-%20System%20Simulation.aspx) platform that combines HYBRID with HERON and RAVEN. 

Currently,the HYBRID repository is based on:

* RAVEN : RAVEN v 1.1 (and newer). See [GITHUB WEBSITE](https://github.com/idaholab/raven)
* TRANSFORM-Library : TRANsient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models. See [GITHUB WEBSITE](https://github.com/ORNL-Modelica/TRANSFORM-Library)
* DYMOLA: DYMOLA 2020x or newer. See [Dymola Website](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/catia/products/dymola/?woc=%7B%22category%22%3A%5B%22category%2Fdymola%22%5D%7D&wockw=card_content_cta_1_url%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fblogs.3ds.com%2Fcatia%2F%22)
